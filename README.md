<h1>🔐 Java Password Generator</h1>
A secure and flexible password generator built with Java, designed to help users create strong, complex passwords for their accounts. This project promotes cybersecurity awareness by encouraging the use of unique and secure passwords for each login.

<h3>📄 Project Description</h3>
With the rise in cyber threats, using simple or repeated passwords puts users at significant risk. This Java-based application generates strong, randomized passwords to help users protect their accounts.

<h3>🔑 Key Highlight:</h3>
To further improve security, the project can be extended to encrypt and securely store passwords using concepts from Cryptography and the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA).

<h3>💡 Features</h3>
✅ Generate strong, random passwords

🔢 User-defined password length

🔁 Includes uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters

🔐 Ready for extension with encryption and secure storage

📦 Clean and modular Java code

<h3>🛠️ Technologies Used</h3>
Java

Jdk

Object-Oriented Programming
